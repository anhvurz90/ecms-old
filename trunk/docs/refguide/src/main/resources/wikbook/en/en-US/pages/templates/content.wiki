*Overview*

The templates are applied to a node type or a metadata mixin type. There are two types of templates:

* *Dialogs*: are in the HTML form that allows creating node instances.
* *Views*: are in the HTML fragments which are used to display nodes.

From the ECM admin portlet, the _Manage Template_ lists existing node types associated to Dialog and/or View templates. These templates can be attached to permissions (in the usual _membership\:group form), so that a specific one is displayed according to the rights of the user (very useful in a content validation workflow activity).

*Document Type*

The checkbox defines if the node type should be considered as the *Document type* or not. *Sites Explorer* considers such nodes as user content and applies the following behavior:

* View template will be used to display the document type nodes.
* Document types nodes can be created by the '_Add Document_' action.
* Non-document types are hidden (unless the _'Show non document types'_ option is checked).

Templates are written by using [Groovy Templates|http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates] that requires some experiences with JCR API and HTML notions.
