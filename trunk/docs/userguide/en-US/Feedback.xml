  <!--NOTE: THE FOLLOWING ENTITIES WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN YOUR BUGZILLA URL.
            YOU WILL NEED TO CORRECT THE URL MANUALLY.
      &PRODUCT_NAME; of the form "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform"
      &BZ_COMPONENT; of the form "doc-triage" (as listed in Bugzilla)
      &PRODUCT_VERSION; of the form "5.0.0" (as listed in Bugzilla, to minimise confusion)
      The above entities should be defined in your Book_Name.ent file so that
      this file can be included in your Publican Common Content directory and added to 
      all Middleware books with minimal fuss.

      These entities should not affect translated documents, since Bugzilla is not localised.
